# autolayout-glitch

Test with iPhone and if using simulator then enable the software keyboard. 

You will see many visual glitches just playing around scrolling, selecting fields and rotating.

For a simple repeatable example.

- Scroll down to the bottom.

- Select one of the last couple of UITextFields, so that the UITableView will need to scroll to ensure the field will be visible.

- Rotate the device.
